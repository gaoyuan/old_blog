  <p>The Bayesian approach to machine learning replaces the sauce of optimization by that of probability. Instead of maximizing the likelihood, it introduces prior to the parameters and calculates the posterior distribution of the parameters after seeing all the data using Bayes&#39; rule (of course!). The posterior distribution captures our beliefs about the parameters, and it is definitely more informative than a single optimal set of parameters learned from maximizing the likelihood. However the extra information comes at a price, since inferring about the posterior is often computationally expansive. For carefully chosen priors and likelihood (conjugacy), it is possible to get analytical solution for the posterior, but unfortunately in reality this is rarely the case, even for the simple logistic regression model.</p>

<p>The logistic regression model is widely used in classification. For simplicity and visualization purposes we will study a simple 2d classification problem, where we assume that the data points can be separated by a line passing through the origin. This is of course a bad assumption in general, but who cares -- no model is perfect anyways.</p>

<p>For logistic regression, we take the probability of a data point $(x_i, y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ belonging to class $z_i \in \{0, 1\}$ as
\begin{equation}
P(Z = 0 | X = (x_i, y_i), A = a, B = b) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-ax_i - by_i)},
\end{equation}
where $A$, $B$ are the parameters in our model. In a Bayesian&#39;s eyes, they are not cold-blooded reptiles (a number) but warm-blooded mammals (random variables). Wait, I love mammals, but what is our prior belief about them, before seeing any training examples? While, I don&#39;t have any, my intuition is just that any line is equally likely to separate the positive and negative training examples. How does that translates to the priors of $A$ and $B$?</p>

<p>For that, let&#39;s look at the probability of points belonging to the opposite class
\begin{equation}
P(Z = 1 | X = (x_i, y_i), A = a, B = b) = 1 - P(Z = 0 | X = (x_i, y_i), A = a, B = b) = \frac{exp(-ax_i - by_i)}{1 + exp(-ax_i - by_i)}.
\end{equation}
If the point $(x_i, y_i)$ happens to lie on the decision boundary, we must have
\begin{equation}
P(Z = 1 | X = (x_i, y_i), A = a, B = b) = P(Z = 0 | X = (x_i, y_i), A = a, B = b).
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the condition
\begin{equation}
ax_i + by_i = 0.
\end{equation}
If a point $(x_i, y_i)$ lies on the decision boundary, it must satisfy the above equation. In other words, the decision boundary is defined by $ax + by = 0$, a line passing through the origin! Great, now the model perfectly resonates with our initial assumptions. The last dessert to make is to define the priors for $A$ and $B$ such that it reflects our belief that any line is equally likely. This is in fact very tricky. We have to formalize the term <em>equally likely</em>. One way to formalize it is to say that the slope of the line is uniformly distributed in $\mathbb{R}$. But what is an uniform distribution in $\mathbb{R}$? The answer is that there is <strong>no</strong> uniform distribution in $\mathbb{R}$! This weired object is opposite to the $\delta$-distribution, but unfortunately is not well-defined in any mathematical framework (distribution theory, measure theory) to the best of my knowledge. It can be seen as a limit of an uniform distribution in $[-M, M]$ as $M \rightarrow \infty$, or as the stationary distribution of a Brownian motion as $t \rightarrow \infty$. OK, I feel that I&#39;m ranting on it too much. Let&#39;s try to formalize it in another way. We can say that the angle formed by the line and the positive x-axis is uniformly distributed in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. This is well defined, and the angle is related to the slope through a nonlinear map $\Theta \mapsto \tan(\Theta)$. What is corresponding distribution of the slope you might ask? It is the Cauchy distribution. Uniformity in angle is essentially different from uniformity in slope, a phenomena similar to Bertrand paradox. Anyway, we can now at least realize our second formalization by sampling $\Theta$ uniformly in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, and take $A = \sin\Theta$ and $B = \cos\Theta$. It turns out there is a way to generate Cauchy distribution even when $A$ and $B$ are independent. If $A$ and $B$ are independent standard normal distributions, their ratio $A/B$ (or equivalently the actual slope $-A/B$) is Cauchy distributed. Here let&#39;s adopt this approach, because the Gaussian (normal) prior is extremely popular and we&#39;ve proved that it satisfies our prior belief in this case.</p>

  <p>Today I talked with Professor Mark Kot about my progress in the marathon of PhD. Mark was very helpful and offered me lots of advice. I&#39;m about to take my general exam this year, so it&#39;s important to keep in mind the rules.</p>

<p>Both the general exam and the final thesis defense are supervised by a committee of four to five professors. Chairman of the committee, of course, is my advisor. One of them is the Graduate School Representative (GPA), and he/she has to be from another department. The main purpose of GPA is to keep my advisor from answering questions for me, thus maintaining the fairness of the exam. Aside from the chairman and GPA, one of the professors must be from the CORE amath faculty. That&#39;s basically all the constraints, so I have the freedom to choose one or two other committee members. And it&#39;s always a good idea to choose professors knowledgeable of the field of my research.</p>

<p>For the final thesis defense, I have to get my written thesis proofread by the reading committee, which are formed by two members from my supervisory committee, before formally arranging an exam date with the graduate school. One important thing to remind my advisor to bring on the final exam is the warrant, a document that has to be signed by all members.</p>

  <p>Consider the following problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The price of a stock is described by a Brownian motion. Suppose the starting price is 5, and the company defaults if ever the price drops to zero. What is the probability that the company is bankrupt at time $T$? What is the probability that the price is above 10 at time $T$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s say the price of the stock is described by the time series $p(t)$. The company is bankrupt at time $T$ if $\exists s \le T$, such that $p(s) = 0$. By the reflection principle of Brownian motion, 
\begin{equation}
P\left(inf_{0\le s\le T}p(s) \le 0\right) = 2P\left(p(T) \le 0\right) = 2\int_{-\infty}^{-5}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi T}}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2T}}.
\end{equation}
For the second question, we need $p(T) &gt; 10$ and $p(s) &gt; 0, \forall 0 \le s \le T$. The probability can be calculated as 
\begin{equation}
P\left(p(T) &gt; 10\right) - P\left(p(T) &gt; 10 \cap inf_{0\le s\le T}p(s) \le 0\right),
\end{equation}
using the fact that $P(A\cap B) = P(A) - P(A\cap B^\complement)$. Note that the latter part is equal to $P\left(p(T) &lt; -10\right)$ (Imagine the price first hits zero, then the probability that it goes back above 10 is equal to a reflecting process that drops below -10). Therefore the probability that the price is above 10 at time $T$ is
\begin{equation}
P\left(p(T) &lt; 0\right) - P\left(p(T) &lt; -10\right) = P\left(-10 \le p(T) &lt; 0\right) = \int_{-15}^{-5}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi T}}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2T}}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s solve the problem in another way. We know that Brownian motion is governed by the following partial differential equation
\begin{equation}
p_t(x, t) = Dp_{xx}(x, t),
\end{equation}
where $p(x,t)$ is the probability density. For a standard Brownian motion, we have $D = 1/2$. Going back to our problem, we know the stock price satisfies this PDE, with boundary conditions $p(0, t) = 0$ and $p(x, t) \rightarrow 0, x \rightarrow \infty$. The absorbing boundary condition reflects the fact that once the price drops to zero, we are at the point of no return. The initial condition for the density is given by $p(x, 0) = \delta(x - 5)$.</p>

<p>To solve for this PDE with the above initial and boundary conditions, one always apply the Green function and the method of images. That is, we imagine another point source that is outside of the domain (at $x = -5$) which counteracts the point source at $x = 5$ to give us the boundary condition. The solution is therefore the superposition of two Green functions
\begin{equation}
p(x, t) = G(5) - G(-5) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi t}}\left(e^{\frac{-(x-5)^2}{2t}} - e^{\frac{-(x+5)^2}{2t}} \right).
\end{equation}
See a plot of this density:</p>

  <p>English is a language that has a concatinative morphology. For example, the word <em>preinstallation</em> can be split into three parts -- a prefix <em>pre</em>, a stem <em>install</em> and a suffix <em>ation</em>. Given a corpus of english words, how do we discover the prefixes and suffixes computationally? This is an interesting question, for we can use similar methods to analyze other languages that also share a concatinative morphology.</p>

<p>The corpus of english words can be represented by a forward tree (and a backward tree). The root of the forward tree is the token that denotes the start of word. Each node in the tree corresponds to a character. A word in the corpus is therefore a path starting from the root. Similarly, for the backward tree, the root is the end of word token. A path starting from the root corresponds to a word reading backwards.</p>

<p>After building this tree representation, we can calculate the frequency of each node, which is defined as the frequency of the path starting from the root to that node. Since prefixes(or suffixes) tend to appear more often, high frequency candidates are more likely to be considered prefixes(or suffixes) given a fixed character sequence length, or equivalently, a fixed depth in the tree. For instance, for a forward tree, we sort the candidates with tree depth 5 by their frequencies, we get (below the root, i.e. start of word token, is ignored)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>candidate,frequency</p>

<p>OVER,378</p>

<p>INTE,338</p>

<p>COMP,233</p>

<p>CONS,212</p>

<p>UNDE,205</p>

<p>TRAN,183</p>

<p>CONT,179</p>

<p>STRA,150</p>

<p>COMM,142</p>

<p>PRES,133</p>

<p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that we can capture some prefixes solely by their frequencies. The guy on the top of the list -- <em>OVER</em> is a common prefix. However, a lot of the high frequency stuff are not actually prefixes, like <em>INTE</em> and <em>UNDE</em>. Why do they have a high frequency though? That is because <em>INTER</em> and <em>UNDER</em> are prefixes. So high frequency itself is not a sufficient criterion for a prefix.</p>

<p>It turns out we can eliminate the bad ones by the distribution of their children. For all the characters following <em>INTE</em>, most of their occurancies should be <em>R</em>, therefore the distribution of the children of <em>INTE</em> should be highly biased. A measure that people usually use to discribe this is called <strong>Entropy</strong>. It is defined as $-\sum_ip_i \ln p_i$, where $p_i$ is the probability of the i-th child. A high entropy implies the children are evenly distributed. Candidate with a high entropy is evidence for a good cut between prefix and stem. That is because varies stems can be attached to the same prefix, so the character following the prefix is rather chaotic.</p>

<p>It turns out there exist some cases where the boundary of a prefix or suffix does not have a high entropy. The suffix <em>-ing</em> is a good example. Unfortunately, <em>ling</em> appears more often than other <em>-ing</em>&#39;s, like <em>ting</em> or <em>ming</em>. Therefore if you look at <em>ing</em>, it doesn&#39;t have a very high entropy. Combining the frequency and entropy criterions helps a lot, but there are still some corner cases.</p>

<p>What if we print the frequency and entropy path of each candidate? Below we selected the depth-6 candidates that have both high frequencies and high entropies. We print the frequency and entropy path of each candidate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B L A C K 62 2.44667
B L A C   63 0.0815104
B L A 235 2.2194
B L   642 1.52547
B 8561 1.94162</p>

F(x) = \int_0^x k(x,y)f(y)dy, x \in (0,1),
\end{equation}
As an example, let $k(x,y) = x^2y$ and $f(x)=x$. Calculate $F&#39;(x)$ in two different ways: (i) using the formula you found, and (ii) by calculating $F(x)$ and taking a derivative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the definition of derivative,
\begin{equation}
F&#39;(x) = \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{F(x+\epsilon)-F(x)}{\epsilon} = \left(\int_0^{x+\epsilon}k(x+\epsilon,y)f(y)dy - \int_0^x k(x,y)f(y)dy\right)/\epsilon
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\left(\int_0^{x+\epsilon}k(x+\epsilon,y)f(y)dy - \int_0^{x+\epsilon}k(x,y)f(y)dy + \int_0^{x+\epsilon}k(x,y)f(y)dy - \int_0^x k(x,y)f(y)dy\right)/\epsilon
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\left(\int_0^{x+\epsilon}\frac{k(x+\epsilon,y)-k(x,y)}{\epsilon} f(y)dy  + \frac{1}{\epsilon}\int_x^{x+\epsilon}k(x,y)f(y)dy \right) = \int_0^xk_x(x,y)f(y)dy + k(x,x)f(x)
\end{equation}
In the derivation above, we used the continuously differentiability of $k$ and the continuity of $f$ in exchanging the integral and limit at the second last step.</p>

<p>For the example $k(x,y)=x^2y$ and $f(x)=x$, we first use our formula:
\begin{equation}
\int_0^xk_x(x,y)f(y)dy + k(x,x)f(x) = \int_0^x2xy^2dy + x^4 = \frac{5}{3}x^4.
\end{equation}
If we calculate it directly, we get
\begin{equation}
\int_0^xk(x,y)f(y)dy = \int_0^xx^2y^2dy = \frac{1}{3}x^5. 
\end{equation}
Then by taking the derivative of $\frac{1}{3}x^5$ respect to $x$ we get the same solution.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First we find two vectors in the space and then we use Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize them. </p>

<p>The general way of finding the two vectors are to assume its form $p(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$. The two conditions $p(1)=p&#39;(1)=0$ gives us two constrains so that only two variables among $a,b,c$ and $d$ are flexible. That is also the reason why the space is two dimensional. We have
\begin{equation}
\cases{
    a + b + c + d = 0\cr
    3a + 2b + c = 0

\end{equation}
We find two linear independent solutions

<p>By setting $x&#39; = y&#39; = 0$, we get the only possible fixed point $(0, 0)$. The Jacobian of the vector field $(y + x^2y, -x + 2xy)$ is
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
    2xy &amp; 1 + x^2 \cr
    -1 + 2y &amp; 2x

\right)

At the origin, the Jacobian becomes
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; 1\cr
    -1 &amp; 0
\end{matrix}
\right)
\end{equation}
The two eigenvalues of the Jacobian are both purely imaginary. So we cannot say it is stable or unstable. By plotting the vector field around the origin, we can see that it is a center.</p>

<p>Consider the ordinary differential equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} = -100y
\end{equation}
Your unsophisticated friend is using the forward Euler method to solve this equation over the time interval [0, 5]. He observes a discrete approximation to the solution $y(t)$ whose absolute value increases over time. Is this possible? If so, characterize the time step that he is using. Now answer the same question using the backward Euler method.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>For the forward Euler method, we have $y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n)$, where $h$ is the time spacing. In our case it will become $y_{n+1} = y_n + h(-100y_n) = (1-100h)y_n$. To make the absolute value of $y(t)$ increases over time, we have $|y_{n+1}| &gt; |y_n|$, which gives us $1-100h &gt; 1$ or $1-100h &lt; -1$. Since the timestep $h$ is positive, only the latter case is possible. In that case $h &gt; 0.02$.</p></li>
<li><p>For the backward Euler method, we have $y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_{n+1})$. In our case it will become $y_{n+1} = y_n + h(-100y_{n+1})$. To make the absolute value of $y(t)$ increases over time, we have $|y_{n+1}| &gt; |y_n|$, which gives us $0 &lt; 1+100h &lt; 1$ or $-1 &lt; 1+100h &lt; 0$. Since the timestep $h$ is positive, neither case is possible. Therefore it is impossible if backward Euler method is used.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we make some plots of the forward Euler method. Note that if we set $h = 0.02$, the absolute value of $y(t)$ will remain the same. In fact it will be oscillating because $y_{n+1} = -y_n$. Below is a plot of the case. We initialize $y(0) = 1$.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/fig1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we set $h &gt; 0.02$, it will be like</p>

<p>If we set $h$ slightly smaller than $0.02$, it is still not working correctly, but the amplitude of the solution will not increase.</p>

<p>If we set $h$ small enough, we get the correct behavior</p>

  <p>I&#39;m currently playing with the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, which is a word-pronunciation dictionary that contains more than 100,000 items. In dealing with the massive amount of data, I&#39;ve learned some text processing techniques which I think is quite useful because these kinds of tasks, i.e. processing data, are frequently encountered, and being efficient in text manipulation will certainly save our lives.</p>

<p>The first tool is <em>tr</em>, which can translate some chars into other chars. As far as I know, it does not support regex. For example, below is a segment of the n-gram counts of the phonemes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lt;s&gt; T UH SH 1</p>

<p>&lt;s&gt; T AE    71</p>

<p>&lt;s&gt; T AE B  8</p>

<p>&lt;s&gt; T AE N  9</p>

<p>&lt;s&gt; T AE K  19</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if I want to keep only the numbers? The following command should work:</p>

<pre> tr -cd '[:digit:]\n' &lt; inputfile </pre>

<p>That means we delete(-d) all the chars except(-c) the numbers([:digit:], which is same as [0-9]) and line break(\n).</p>

<p>For the the same task we may also use the following <em>perl</em> command:</p>

<pre> perl -i -pe 's/[^0-9\n]//g' inputfile </pre>

<p>The -i argument means in-place edit, so the inputfile will simply be changed. You can write -i.bak to keep a backup, or simply ignore this option and the result will be displayed in the terminal. The -e argument makes perl code to execute on the command line. And the -p ensures the command to be executed per line. In princple, you can write any valid perl command in the quote. That implies, for instance, you can specify the substitution to happen conditionally on those lines that you desire.</p>

<p>Instead of using perl, we can simply use <em>sed</em> almost the same way. Sed is especially designed to do substitution, as its name suggests.</p>

<p>The <em>sort</em> command can sort the files by lines, with the -n argument for numerical sorting and -r for descending order. The -k option specify which column to sort. Quite convenient.</p>

<p>Another powerful command is <em>awk</em>. For example, you can obtain the sum of the first column of all the lines in a file by a one liner:</p>
